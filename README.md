# How to run the code:
Install python interpreter, we used python3 but our code does work with select python versions. If you are using python instead, please replace all the following python3 with python for these terminal commands.

Fisrt create a virtual environment with: python3 -m venv venv

Now activate that virtual environment with: source venv/bin/activate for macOS / Linux or venv\Scripts\activate.bat for windows OS. Your terminal should now show (venv) to confirm the environment is active.

Next, navigate to our final iteration using this command in terminal: cd final-iteration-combination in terminal at the project base.

Then you are going to install the requirements for our project using this command in terminal: pip install -r requirements.txt

And finally, you can run our projects main and final iteration with this command in terminal: python3 main.py or this could be python main.py depending on the python interpreter you've got.

Hopefully now running, you should see a camera and file window. Press Q or ESC to quit the application. Enjoy!
